I developed Kisan-Lens to bridge the technology gap for smallholder farmers in regions with low connectivity. The goal was to create a free, accessible, and reliable tool that works without an internet connection, putting the power of on-device AI directly into the hands of those who feed the world.

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project was built with a focus on performance, accessibility, and offline capabilities.

* **Frontend:** **React 19**
* **On-Device AI:** **TensorFlow.js**
* **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS**
* **Camera Integration:** React Webcam
* **Icons:** Lucide React
* **PWA Core:** Service Workers, Web App Manifest
* **Deployment:** **Vercel**

### Technical Highlights
The primary technical challenge was implementing an efficient, on-device AI model. The architecture is built to support a real **EfficientNet-Lite** or **MobileNetV2** model. All image processing happens on the client-side, which was a key decision to guarantee user privacy and enable the app's powerful offline functionality.
